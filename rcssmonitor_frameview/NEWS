  followed by several drawing commands.
  For example

    '_2D_ LINE col=ff0000 (0,20,40,20) (0,20,40,0); CIRCLE col=0000ff (0,0,20)
       (0,0,40); STRING (-20,0,"my_pos");'

  will draw 2 red lines, 2 blue circles and a string on top of the soccer
  field.

  Look into
  ascii_processor.C: AsciiProcessor::ins_obj(...)
  smonitor_dev.C:    SMonitorDevice::server_interpret_frameview_msg(...)
  for more details.
